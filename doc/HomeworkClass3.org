* Homework comments
  - Complete any previous homework.  You need to be comfortable with 
    programming your robot.
  - Next class is the final class before competition.  I will be signing
    off Blue Cards.
  - Get your Blue Cards signed by the Scoutmaster!
  - If you're stuck for a long time, send me an email and be specific with
    any relevant error messages or behavior you're seeing.  You can commit
    changes to GitHub and sync so I can see your program.
  - Commit your changes to GitHub so you don't lose your work.
  - With GitHub, you can work on different computers as long as you
    commit your work and sync with GitHub.  Just make sure you install
    the necessary tools on the other computer following the instructions
    in the [[./RoboticsMB_Reference.org][Robotics MB Reference Guide]].
* Robot Design
  1. In your Engineering Notebook, finalize your design for the competition.
     Refer to the [[./2015RoboticsCompetition.html][Robotic Competition Rules]] and come up with approaches for:
     1) How to load/unload the payload
     2) How to carry the payload
     3) The logic required to navigate through the obstacle course
        An example logic diagram is shown below.

  2. Build your robot payload carrier, loading and unloading mechanisms.
     Next class you will to do some trial runs on a course, so
     be ready!  Your robot must be ready for testing for the Class #4.
     There will not be much time on competition day to warm up.

  3. If you are part of a team (there is only one team of two scouts)...
     I expect you to utilize both of your controller boards in your design.
     With four motors, you should be able to do something interesting.  
     Each scout should understand the entire robot's design and implementation.
     
* Robotics Merit Badge Workbook
  You should have the following sections filled out so I can sign off 
  the requirements.  Read the Merit Badge booklet to learn the answers
  to the questions.
  - 1a and b - Safety
  - Section 2 a, b, c
  - Section 3 - General knowledge.  Discuss 3 of 5 major Robotic fields
  - Section 4  
    - Describe your approach to performing the competition tasks
    - Document your program logic.
    - We will do section e, testing robot, during our next class.
  - Section 6b and 7
